Neutron IDE is a web based integrated development environment.

Neutron IDE was created to be a web IDE that satisfies the following:
  1. Is free and open source
  2. Is able to install on an existing development server for both performance and privacy of your code.
  3. Is easy to install and secure out of the box.

Neutron IDE is based on Ace Editor (http://ace.ajax.org/) and currentely has the following features:
  * Syntax highlighting
  * Auto indentation and outdent
  * Themes
  * Image editing via Pixlr: http://pixlr.com/
  * File browser
  * Tabbed interface

In the near future I hope to:
  * Support all Ace Editor customizations and allow easy access to them.
  * Integrate more 3rd Party tools for editing binary files.
  * Integrate project support.
  * Integrate features like search, replace, directoy search, etc.
  * Integrate a native client ssh client.
