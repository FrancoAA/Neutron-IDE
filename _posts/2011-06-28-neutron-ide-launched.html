<p>
  The next release of Church Source is available!  This is a small update that allows you to tweak the Screen and Print CSS. 
  This is necessary if you need to tweak the checkout labels for a different printer size than what I designed for.  If you wish 
  to tweak the CSS, copy the existing CSS files to the uploads directory and edit away.  Then update the PRINT_CSS and SCREEN_CSS 
  configuration settings in the admin with the paths to your new CSS.

<p>
  To migrate from version 0.2 follow these steps:<br/>
  <ol>
    <li>Download and extract Version 0.3.</li>
    <li>Move the directories <strong>static/uploads</strong> and <strong>static/cache</strong> from your old install to the V0.3 install.</li>
    <li>Run <strong>./manage.py migrate</strong></li>
  </ol>
