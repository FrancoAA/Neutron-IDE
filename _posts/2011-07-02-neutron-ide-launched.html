<p>
  Neutron IDE is a web based integrated development environment.
</p>
<p>
  With release of Chrome OS and the advancement to a more web based society, I thought it only fitting to start using a web based IDE.  There are already quite a few web based IDE services out there.  While these are great, you often can't edit code directly off a development server you run, or if you can, it loads files painfully slow.  I also believe in using free and open source tools for development.
</p>
<p>
So to sum it up, I would like a web based editor that is the following:
<ol>
  <li>Free and open source</li>
  <li>Able to install on an existing development server for speed.</li>
  <li>Easy to install and secure out of the box.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
  After reviewing web based editors, I was left with only the Ecplise Orion project at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/orion/">http://www.eclipse.org/orion/</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Orion, while promising, right now only lets you edit Javascript and CSS. Major Fail!
</p>
<p>
  So I created Neutron IDE.  A web based IDE that you can quickly install on a development server to edit your code in the cloud.
</p>
<p>
  Neutron IDE will be in heavy development the next few months but should have enough features to keep you coding happy for now.
</p>
<p>
  Currently, the IDE should let you edit any text file and save it.  Some of the editor customizations work, but a lot do not.
</p>
<p>
  In the near future I hope to:
  <ul>
    <li>Support all editor customizations and allow easy access to them.</li>
    <li>Integrate 3rd Party tools for editing images and other binary files.</li>
    <li>Integrate project support.</li>
    <li>Integrate features like search, replace, directoy search, etc.</li>
    <li>Integrate a native client ssh client.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
