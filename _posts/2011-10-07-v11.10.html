<p>
  Today version 11.10 of Neutron IDE is released.  With this version, Neutron 
  has changed to time based releases.  This will help hopefully make the 
  version number actually mean something.  Here is what is included in Version 
  11.10.
  
  <ul>
    <li>Ability to edit images with <a href="http://pixlr.com/">Pixlr</a></li>
    <li>Upgrade to <a href="http://ace.ajax.org">Ace Editor v0.2</a>.</li>
    <li>Several bug fixes and UI enhancements.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

  Pixlr has stopped working for me because it is not loading images from URL. It
  is a general issue with Pixlr and not specific to Neutron IDE.  Hopefully they 
  will fix it soon.

  Looks like Pixlr is working again.  :-)
