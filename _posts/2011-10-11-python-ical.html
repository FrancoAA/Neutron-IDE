  Recently while trying to boost performance of 
  <a href="http://culturemap.com/">CultureMap.com</a>, I noticed our iCal feed 
  was really slow.  It was taking almost 20 seconds to generate the feed.  So 
  first I checked database queries.  Only 1 query was executing with a fairly 
  large amount of data, but it was quick.  Then I figured since our calendar of 
  events had grown maybe it was due to the amount of data being processed.  So 
  I turned down the query range from 366 days to 90 days.  The request was 
  faster but still too slow.  Next I started timing different parts of the code 
  to see what was taking the longest.
</p>
<p>
  By far what was taking the longest was one line:<br/>
  <code>icalstream = calObj.serialize()</code>
</p>
<p>
  This line generates the text for the iCal feed for the 
  <a href="http://vobject.skyhouseconsulting.com/">Python VObject</a> library. 
  VObject lets you create iCal feeds fairly easy, and I have used it a lot in the
  past.  But from my tests I have found it very inefficient.
</p>
<p>
  So I tried out another Python library called 
  <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/icalendar/">icalendar</a>.  Switching 
  over was fairly easy since both libraries work in a similar manner.  The same 
  request that took 20 seconds in VObject took less than 2 seconds in icalendar.
  I went ahead and reduced the number of days queried and have the request down 
  to less than a second now.
</p>
<p>
  Lesson learned: if you have an iCal feed of any good size use 
  <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/icalendar/">icalendar</a> and stay away 
  from VObject.
