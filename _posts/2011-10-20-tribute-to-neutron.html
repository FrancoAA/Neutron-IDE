<p>
  If you haven't figured it out yet, Neutron IDE was named after my cat Neutron.
  We knew since he was small that he had 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_leukemia_virus">Feline Leukemia</a>.
  He still lived a great life and loved playing outside.  A few weeks ago he went
  out the cat door and never came back.  I'm assuming his maladies got the best 
  of him.

  So this post is a tribute to a great cat. Hopefully, Neutron IDE can live up to
  his name.  Take a minute to view the slideshow below.
