<p>
  The development version of Neutron recently switched the default image editor 
  from <a href="http://pixlr.com/">Pixlr</a> to 
  <a href="http://www.aviary.com/online/image-editor">Phoenix</a>. Even though I
  like Pixlr better, its API seems to poop out often.  I actually had this same 
  problem several years ago with Pixlr with another project and had to switch off
  it then too.  With that said, I thought would write a summary of all the online
  photo editors I looked at why I chose Phoenix.
</p>
<p>
  To start, here were the criteria I used to pick a photo editor for Neutron:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Advanced Tools: The editor needed to have more than just cropping and 
      effects.  I wanted an editor that could be used seriously for daily 
      development tasks.
    </li>
    <li>
      Transparency and Layers: The editor should be able to handle PNG
      transparency and layers.  PNGs are just about all I work with nowadays if I
      have a say in it.
    </li>
    <li>
      API: The editor needed to have a simple API to get images into the service
      and then save them back to Neutron IDE.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  With these criteria I narrowed down the choices to the following editors:
  <ul>
    <li>Picnik: http://www.picnik.com/</li>
    <li>Pixlr: http://pixlr.com/</li>
    <li>Sumo Paint: http://www.sumopaint.com/home/</li>
    <li>Splashup: http://www.splashup.com/</li>
    <li>Phoenix: http://www.aviary.com/online/image-editor</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h3>Picnik</h3>
<p>
  Picnik (now owned by Google) is very easy to use and has a great API, but
  unless you pay for the premium account, you don't get support for layers. 
  I really wanted to stay away from a paid service if I could for default 
  integration into Neutron IDE.  However, even with the premium service, it did
  not handle PNG transparency and I couldn't figure out how to use layers easily.
</p>
<h3>Pixlr</h3>
<p>
  Pixlr had everything I was looking for, but it seems that their API is hit or 
  miss. I had the same problem in the past and tried them out again hoping this 
  would not be the case now but it still was.
</p>
<h3>Sumo Paint</h3>
<p>
  Sumo Paint was another great and highly advanced online photo editor. Sumo 
  Paint has an API, but requires user interaction to setup. For Neutron IDE's 
  purposes I was hoping to avoid this, but I highly recommend this photo editor.
</p>
<h3>Splashup</h3>
<p>
  Splashup again was another great and highly advanced online photo editor, but 
  no API.  This editor is another highly recommended tool to try though.
</p>
<h3>Phoenix</h3>
<p>
  Phoenix seemed to offer all the functionality needed and has a decent API. When
  importing tranparent PNGs, it does add a white background layer, but it is 
  trivial to delete the layer and continue editing.
</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>
  Phoenix definitely rose from the ashes and beat all the rest. However, several
  of these editors are still great if your not taking into consideration an API
  and integrating them into another project.  Leave a comment and let me know
  what your favorite is.
