  One of my favorite things to do when I go on trips is to bring my 
  <a href="http://www.roku.com/">Roku</a>.  It is small and fits easily in any
  laptop bag, and then when I get to my hotel I can watch 
  <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>, play music via 
  <a href="http://www.roku.com/pandora-partner">Pandora</a>, or my watch own videos with the
  <a href="https://github.com/netguy204/roku_media_server">My Media Channel</a>.
  This beats having to pay high prices for lame hotel videos you don't want 
  to watch in the first place.

  Most hotel TVs have RCA or HDMI inputs and free wireless, so we are all ready 
  to go right?!  Sometimes it is not that easy.  Some hotel TVs will try to lock
  you out of switching inputs by not providing an input button on your remote or
  by switching back to the hotel input automatically.
</p>
<p>
  To switch inputs first look for buttons on your TV. Most TVs have manual
  buttons, your just going to just get off your butt and look for them. If there
  are no buttons, your going to have to get a universal remote.  I never ran into
  a TV with no buttons, but I heard some hotels do this to prevent switching off
  their input.

<p>
  If you have the problem of the TV switching back to the hotel cable input, 
  then you need to look in back of the TV. There will be a ethernet or smaller
  phone like wire.  Unplug the wire and usually that does the trick of the TV 
  automatically switching back.  If the problem still occurs go ahead an unplug 
  any other inputs from the hotel.

  having your media on the go!
