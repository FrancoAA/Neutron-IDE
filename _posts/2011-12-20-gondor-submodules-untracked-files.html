<p>
  I recently started to use <a href="https://gondor.io/">Gondor.IO</a> for Django
  deployments. It makes it really easy to deploy a project and not have to worry
  about sysadmin duties. The trade off to this is that since it is a service, you
  have to play within certain rules. So far these rules have not been constraining
  and often show me better ways to do things. However, I did run into a road block
  recently.
</p>
<p>
  Gondor integrates with your version control system (Git or Mercurial) to make a
  tarball for deployment.  This means you must track all the files you want to 
  deploy. This is definitely a constraint on deployment but a
  constraint that is good practice. However, I recently switched a project to use
  <a href="http://book.git-scm.com/5_submodules.html">Git submodules</a> which 
  while this is tracked code it is not supported by Gondor's client. You also may
  have one off configuration or settings files that are untracked that you need
  to deploy.
</p>
<p>
  At first I looked for a way for the Gondor Client to support submodules. It is
  great that the <a href="https://github.com/eldarion/gondor-client">Gondor Client
  is on GitHub</a> so you can fork it and mess around. I found some forks of the
  client that support submodules, but they didn't look maintained. While mucking
  around in the client code, I saw support for untracked files. No docs for this
  feature, but it is there.
</p>
<p>
  Basically, the client lets you add files to the config INI file for additional
  non-version controlled files you want to include. I figured adding my submodule
  files to the config would be a good way to deploy without having to use a custom
  client. One problem, I have a butt load of files to add to the INI, and to add
  each one individually would suck.
</p>
<p>
  So I wrote a small script to recursively search directories and add these files
  for me. You can get the script at:
  <a href="https://github.com/pizzapanther/Gondor-Untracked-Files">https://github.com/pizzapanther/Gondor-Untracked-Files</a>
</p>
<p>
  Or install with pip like so:
  <pre>pip install -e git+https://github.com/pizzapanther/Gondor-Untracked-Files.git#egg=untracked</pre>
</p>
<p>
  Usage:
  <pre>cd django_project_dir
untracked plugins/cool-plugin1/ plugins/cool-plugin2/</pre>
</p>
<p>
  By default it will ignore *.pyc and your .git folders, but there are options to
  change that. When your done you should get an INI file that looks like:
  <pre>[files]
