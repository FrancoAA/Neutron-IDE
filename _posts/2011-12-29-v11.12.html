<p>
  Just in time for the new year, version 11.12 of Neutron IDE is released. This month's release only adds
  one feature, but it is a biggy. Here is what is included in Version 11.12.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Search Tool:</strong> The search tool allows you to search your 
        current tab, all open tabs, or a directory.  It also includes a replace 
        mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
        The directory search uses <a href="http://celeryproject.org/">Celery</a> 
        to execute tasks asynchronously while the Neutron IDE interface updates 
        your the results as they come in.
      </p>
      <p>
        The directory search in particular is a very powerful tool so use it with
        caution.  As said in Spiderman: 
        &quot;With great power comes great responsibility&quot;.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
