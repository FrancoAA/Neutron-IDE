categories:
- release
---

<p>
  Squeaking in right before the end of the month, here's Version 12.01. It packs
  a few new features that may make Neutron less stable than usual.  So this 
  release should be considered beta, but it should be good enough for everyday
  use.  Read below for more details.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Tornado Web Server:</strong> The default built in web server is
        now <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/">Tornado</a>. The default web 
        server was changed so that web sockets could be incorporated into the IDE.
        To start the new server simply run: <code>./neutronide.py</code>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Terminal:</strong> The terminal lets you have command line joy 
        right in your web browser. Right now this is an experimenal feature, but
        what is more fun than living on the edge?  So try it out today. Look for 
        the terminal under the tools menu button.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Quick Search:</strong> Quick search makes it easier to do a
        simple search. Just press Ctrl-Q or click in the box at the top of the 
        IDE and start typing.  Press enter to go on to the next item when
        searching.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Other Stuff:</strong> Kendo UI was upgraded to release 1.0, right
        click menus were streamlined so the cancel button is no longer needed, 
        and you can now middle click on tabs to close them now.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

  <strong>Some Notes on the Terminal</strong><br>
  Having a terminal in a browser is not a trivial thing, that is why this first
  release is considered experimental.  However, it works pretty darn good for an
  experiment.  I've optimized several factors to make it as speedy as possible 
  over the web. I've also used quite a few open source projects to create the
  terminal and want to thank them.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/selectel/pyte">PyTE</a>: a Python terminal
      that is the basis for the server side terminal code.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/">Tornado</a>: a Python based web
      server which supports web sockets so that server to client communication
      is extremely quick.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/shellinabox/">Shell in a Box</a>: Shell 
      in a Box is a web based terminal which provided me with the javascript 
      necessary to handle keyboard inputs properly.  This is extremely hairy
      stuff!
    </li>
  </ul>
