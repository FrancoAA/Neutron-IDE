<p>
  Squeaking in right before the end of the month, here's Version 12.01. It packs
  a few new features that may make Neutron less stable than usual.  So this 
  release should be considered beta, but it should be good enough for everyday
  use.  Read below for more details.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Tornado Web Server:</strong> The default built in web server is
        now <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/">Tornado</a>. The default web 
        server was changed so that web sockets could be incorporated into the IDE.
        To start the new server simply run: <code>./neutronide.py</code>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Terminal:</strong> The terminal lets you have command line joy 
        right in your web browser. Right now this is an experimenal feature, but
        what is more fun than living on the edge?  So try it out today.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The directory search in particular is a very powerful tool so use it with
        caution.  As said in Spiderman: 
        &quot;With great power comes great responsibility&quot;.
      </p>

  </ul>
