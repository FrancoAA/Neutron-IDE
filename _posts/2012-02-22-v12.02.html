  modern web browser.  Listed below is a list of everything included in this 
  release.

      the ability to resize the terminal, the integration of dtach to support
      persistent terminals even if you lose connectivity, editable terminal 
      preferences, and scroll buttons were added.

      Upgrades to executable: The executable neutronide.py was upgraded to 
      include default backgrounding of the proccess, default output to log files, 
      and a change of default log and database file locations.  If upgrading 
      please see the
